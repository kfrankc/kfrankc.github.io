      <title>Lessons from 1 Year at Microsoft</title>
      <link>https://kfrankc.com/posts/lessons-microsoft/</link>

      <description>This was originally published on LinkedIn .
As 2018 comes to a close, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some of the lessons I learned this past year as a Program Manager at Microsoft. These opinions and observations are my own, and should be taken with the understanding that everyone&amp;rsquo;s professional journey is different. Some of these apply directly to the Program Management discipline, while others apply to anyone starting their first full-time job.</description>

      <title>What makes Black Panther a great film</title>

      <description>A great film consists not only of a great cast, but also a great director, screenwriter, composer, cinematographer, and costume designer.
Black Panther Fever is REAL, and here are some of the amazing people who made this film great.
Director
Ryan Coogler is a visionary man. Just look at how he deconstructs a complicated fight sequence from the film in terms of both the action and the symbolism. Coogler is not merely making another superhero film; he’s using his platform to tell the story about a fictional African nation uninterrupted by colonialism, a stand-alone film not dependent on others in the Marvel cinematic universe, and a narrative about multiple strong, independent female characters in an action-focused film.</description>

      <title>Turning 20</title>

      <description>Yesterday, my parents celebrated my birthday early, because I’ll be at college during my actual birthday later in January. Usually, I reflect about being 1 year older AFTER my birthday, but since I’ve been having this ‘early celebration’ for a while, so I thought I’ll jot down some of my thoughts about the big two-zero now.
 Turning 20 is amazing. The moment when the tens-digit of your age changes is always a milestone.</description>
