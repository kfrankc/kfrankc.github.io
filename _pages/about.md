I am a Program Manager in the telemetry & analytics team at Microsoft. I am currently also pursuing a Masters in _Data Science_ from University of Washington part-time. 

Previously, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), I graduated with a B.S. in _Computer Science_.

In my undergrad years, I conducted research at [The Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) with [Dr. Thomas Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-lu-a0572329/), and at the [Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning and Autonomy (VCLA)](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/) with [Nishant Shukla](http://shukla.io/) and [Professor Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/index.html). I was an organizer of [LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com/) and a [Resident Assistant (RA)](https://reslife.ucla.edu/employment/ra) for [UCLA Residential Life](https://reslife.ucla.edu/). I also lectured a course on [Cybersecurity](https://kfrankc.me/cs88s/).
