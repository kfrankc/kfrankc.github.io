            <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5918982/">Possessor</a> - A scifi horror that blends the &lsquo;sleeve&rsquo; technology concept of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261227/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Altered Carbon</a> with the cosmic suspense of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Black Mirror</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1070874/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">The Trial of the Chicago 7</a> - A historical legal drama with director/writer Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s iconic fast-paced dialogues and an ensemble cast, including Succession&rsquo;s Jeremy Strong (I didn&rsquo;t even recognize him as Jerry Rubin!)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Primer</a> - An indie scifi with an extremely low budget ($7K!), and showcases perhaps the most convoluted time travel plotline I have ever seen in film (had to watch it a few times to understand)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9770150/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Nomadland</a> - A beautiful drama filmed before the pandemic that somehow delicately captured America&rsquo;s collective desire to travel during the pandemic (#vanlife)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5363618/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Sound of Metal</a> - A drama with a mesmerizing performance by lead actor Riz Ahmed + incredible sound design that lets the audience experience vicariously the initial confusion and pain of losing your hearing</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3833480/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3">The Outpost</a> - A war film that doesn&rsquo;t dwell on the glory of the battle, and shows the brutality of a fight that never seemed to end</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rivers-Roads-Heart-Place-Market/dp/B08T14X268">Rivers and Roads: The Head &amp; The Heart</a> - A documentary-style film that captures the band&rsquo;s performance at the place of their inception: Pike Place Market in Seattle. Filmed before the pandemic &amp; released during the pandemic, it was a beautiful reminder of a time pre-covid</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10633456/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Minari</a> - A drama that rightfully deserves its place as a nominee for Best Pictures, as there is nothing that better represents the American Dream than an immigrant family trying to make it in rural United States in the 1980s</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9426210/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Weathering with You</a> - A romantic fantasy anime that shares some similarities with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5311514/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3">Your Name</a>, but nevertheless ranks high as a coming-of-age story about love and friendship</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8743064/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">See You Yesterday</a> - A scifi that breaks the traditions of this genre, and grounds technological advancement with existing societal issues</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9376612/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</a> - A Marvel blockbuster that pays homage to the kung fu and martial arts genre films that came before it, but not without adding a bit too much CGI for my liking</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Dune</a> - An epic scifi directed by Denis Villeneuve that did the impossible: portrayed the Dune universe on the big screen with jaw-dropping cinematography by Greg Fraser, deafening score by Hans Zimmer (best experienced in theaters), and ensemble cast dedicated to the craft</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9639470/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Last Night in Soho</a> - A psychological horror that plays on our collective desire for nostalgia, only to bring out the ugly side of history that many of us tend to forget</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Memento</a> - A mystery thriller from 2000, considered one of the best works from acclaimed director Christopher Nolan due to its nonlinear narrative, and often considered as the inception of Nolan&rsquo;s obsession with time as a theme in his filmography</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382320/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">No Time to Die</a> - A satisfying, action-packed conclusion to Daniel Craig&rsquo;s James Bond, with full story arcs for many recurring characters from the franchise</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10872600/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Spiderman: No Way Home</a> - An ambitious, bold MCU film that wraps up the Spiderman &lsquo;Home&rsquo; trilogy with <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spider_man_no_way_home">near-perfect</a> Rotten Tomatoes scores from both critics and audiences. For fans of Spiderman and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film will give you joy</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Don&rsquo;t Look Up</a> - While dystopian films mostly follow similar patterns, this black-comedy satire finds some unique angles based on relevant references to our current state of world</p>
