# Music Through The Ages: Billboard Top 100 Charts Analysis

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/bboard_banner.PNG" alt="Billboard Top 100 Charts Analysis" caption="Visualizing popularity (y-axis) and relevance (marker size) for the top 100 songs (x-axis) via a marker chart" %}

For the final project of my Human-Centered Data Science Masters course at UW, I built a reproducible study of song performance in the United States. I used the Billboard Top 100 Charting songs dataset, which contains Billboard weekly top 100 songs and their positions from 1953 to 2019, in an attempt to understand whether songs from the 2010s are outperforming songs from the past.
