# CS 88S: Safety in the Cloud

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/cs88s.png" alt="Cover Photo" caption="Cover Photo used for CS 88S class that I taught at UCLA" %}

During my senior year at UCLA, I lectured on a course called CS 88S: Safety in the Cloud - Introduction to Cybersecurity. The course reached an international audience, with more than 1500+ subscribers to my weekly email list. We covered topics from phishing and social engineering to password authentications and IoT security.
