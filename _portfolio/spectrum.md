# Spectrum Redesign

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/spectrum.png" alt="Spectrum Photo Blog" caption="Redesign of Daily Bruin's Spectrum Photo Blog" %}

One of my best experiences working as a Program Manager at [Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com) was leading the redesign of the Spectrum Photo Blog. We replaced the original Wordpress gallery, and used a variety of responsive libraries such as [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) for the filtering and [fotorama](http://fotorama.io/) for the galleries.
