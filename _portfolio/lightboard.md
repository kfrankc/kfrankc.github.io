# LightBoard

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/lightboard.png" alt="Light Board" caption="Longboard with lights" %}

The lights on this Longboard are programmed to change color based on how fast I am moving, using a hall sensor and a magnet glued to the inside of one wheel. To build this over the course of a weekend, I used two LED stripes, a Teensy Board, a recycled Urinal Battery System, a free phone charger I got from a career fair, and electric tape. Truly, in _hackathon_ style.
