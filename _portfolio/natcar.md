# NATCAR

The goal of NATCAR is to design, build, and race an autonomous car on a track marked by 1’‘-wide white tape. At UCLA, I worked on this year-long project with [Gary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhgary) and [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-sin-852868b5). Watch our winning video below:
