# Blood Flow Visualization

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/bloodflow.gif" alt="Blood Flow Visualization" caption="Visualizing blood flow from `dicom` files" %}

For the final project of my Medical Imaging class at UCLA, [Arvin](https://github.com/arvinn) and I built a website to visualize `dicom` files. We performed frame-by-frame skeletonization of the angiography videos, computed blood flow path using breadth-first-search, and rendered the result in a Javascript-based visualization.
