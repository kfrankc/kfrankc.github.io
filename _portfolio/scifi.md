# SciFi Through The Ages Project

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/scifi_header.png" alt="Lion Dance" caption="Exploring SciFi films on a particular year." %}

For the final project of my Data Visualization class in Fall 2018, my group and I built a website to analyze and explore science fiction films from 1932 to 2016. We used [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) for the data, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for cleaning/cooking, and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for visualization.
