On July 22, [Microsoft announced a $1B deal with OpenAI](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi) to help the research company work towards achieving artificial general intelligence. We wanted to explore OpenAI's offerings, and see if there's potential to utilize their research to enhance Office productivity software. In February 2019, OpenAI published [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), a language model that can generate text based on a short sentence as a jumpstart point. 

We want to incorporate this in a Microsoft Word plugin that allows users to input some ideas, and receive some inspiration from GPT-2 to inspire them further, whether it be the next sentence of their paragraph, next slide of their presentation, or next section of their speech.
