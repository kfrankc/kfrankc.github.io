# Dragon (龙)

_This is part of a series on Chinese Zodiac Animals._

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/dragon.PNG" alt="Chinese Dragon" caption="Unlike Western Dragons, the Chinese Dragon does not have wings, but can still fly." %}

> The dragon in Chinese culture represents a symbol of power, strength, and good luck. Historically, only Chiense emperors can wear robes decorated with dragon patterns.
