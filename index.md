# About

I am a Program Manager in the Telemetry & Analytics team at Microsoft, where I contribute in the following areas:

- Build a unified telemetry platform across Microsoft internal tools and services, using Azure big data technologies ([ApplicationInsights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), [Data Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/), [Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/data-lake/), [CosmosDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction))
- Enable our organization to achieve software service maturity via improving health metrics such as availability, reliability, exceptions, and performance
- Organize mentorship and leadership events for the Early in Career community to learn and grow

I am also a Masters student in _Data Science_ at University of Washington. I like to [draw](https://instagram.com/bykfrankc) from time to time.
