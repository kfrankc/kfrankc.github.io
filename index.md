# PM at Microsoft, [MRW](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/overview/)

My interests are in computer vision, IoT, and [intelligent edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/future-of-cloud/). I am also a Masters student in _Data Science_ at University of Washington.

Previously at UCLA, I graduated with a B.S. in _Computer Science_. There, I was a Researcher at [VCLA](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/), Organizer at [LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com/), [Resident Assistant](https://reslife.ucla.edu/employment/ra), and Student Lecturer on [Cybersecurity](https://kfrankc.com/cs88s/)
